## List of the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Able to view as an app on their mobile device
* Displays chords and tabs for a song
* Able to see chords and tabs in a user friendly way (still deciding on exactly how that will pan out)

## List of tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources that will be used to create this MVP:
* React Native
* Potentially Ruby for building my own API (still deciding on that one)
* JavaScript and React for managing the FE

## If finished developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will be worked on next?
* Awesome scroll functionality and features that really interact with the user.
* A beautifully designed layout with cool CSS effects.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Interactive CSS for responsive scrolling and tricks.
